            <h2>Mobile First Design</h2>
            
            <p>Mobile-first design is a web development approach that prioritizes the design and functionality of a website for mobile devices before adapting it to larger screens such as tablets and desktops. This methodology reflects the growing trend of mobile internet usage, as more people now access the web primarily through their smartphones. By starting with the constraints of smaller screens, developers ensure that the essential features of a website—like navigation, content readability, and user interaction—are optimized for the most limited space. Once the mobile version is established, the design is progressively enhanced for larger devices, adding more complex features and visual elements as screen real estate increases.</p>

            <p>One of the core principles of mobile-first design is that it forces developers to prioritize content. On small screens, there is little room for superfluous elements, so designers must focus on delivering the most important information and actions to users. This results in lean, efficient websites that load quickly and are easy to navigate, even on slower mobile networks. The mobile-first approach also ensures that a website is inherently responsive, meaning it adjusts fluidly to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a seamless experience across devices.</p>

            <h2>Functional Experience</h2>
            <p>Incorporating mobile-first design also aligns with the idea of progressive enhancement—a development philosophy that starts with a basic, functional experience and then adds layers of complexity as the user's browser or device capabilities allow. This ensures that users on older or less powerful devices still receive a functional version of the site, while those with more modern technology get an enhanced experience. By adopting mobile-first design, developers can create websites that are both more accessible and future-proof, responding effectively to the ongoing shift towards mobile browsing.</p>
